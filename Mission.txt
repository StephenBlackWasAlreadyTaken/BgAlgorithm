Issues I want to achieve from this study:

Better BG algorithm:

This includes:

1) Initial calibration algorithm.
2) When is the best time to calibrate.
3) Should we wait 15-20 minutes before applying calibration.
4) noise values of a sensor.
5) When is a sensor considered bad.
6) The liability of the data.
7) Should values be age adjusted. If yes, how?
